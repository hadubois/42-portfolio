# About
This repository I'm gonna expose my 42 journey and what I have learnt. For that I will describe my major projects. If you want more informations about a projet you can check it out. </br></br>
I split my projects in 2 differents categories.
- [42 common core](# Common-core)
- [42 electronics](# Electronics)

# Common-core
The common core is the 42 basic cursus. It allow us to know all the fundamentals an to be a real developper. we start by creating our own library in C and finish by creating an online multiplayer game platform in several languages.

| project name | description |
|--------------| ----------- |
| Webserv      | This project was my favorite, the goal was to recreate a server like nginx from scratch in C++|
| Minishell    | In this one we had to reproduce also from scratch a Linux shell in C
| Inception    | This project was really important because it learn me how to create performant and secure Docker environnement to run Wordpress, MariaDB and NGINX using only Debian images. 

# Electronics
After the common-core I chose to went deeper in embedded and electronics because I like the link between my program and and real object.
For this speciality I done a piscine to learn all the embedded fundamentals in C. Then I made electronic modules that learn me how to make a full electronic project from scratch by learning kicad and molding.

| embedded piscine | In this piscine I learn how to flash, read a data-sheet, use ISP, I2C, UART protocols and use different memories.
| electronic design | By creating my own schematic library, then my own footprint library I design a kicad PCB from scratch and prepare documentation.
| electronic prototyping | Throught Holes and SMD have no secrets to me now!
